# List of problems to be refactored

## 460. LFU Cache
The task was solved with a HashMap and an X-doubly linked list. The doubly linked list should be implemented as a class that can be used later.

As an alternative, a solution with OrderedDict should be implemented.

## 2306. Naming a Company
Refactor it. The solution is supposed to be faster and consume less memory.
